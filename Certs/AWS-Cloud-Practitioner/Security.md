**AWS Shared Responsibility Model:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) is responsible for the cloud (AWS), that includes physical security of data centers, hardware, software, and networking. Customers are responsible for security in the Cloud, protecting customer data, data encryption, Identity and Access Management (IAM), patching operating systems of virtual machines(VMs), and configuring firewalls.

**The 5 Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework (CROPS):**
1. Cost Optimization
2. Reliability
3. Optimization
4. Performance Efficiency
5. Security

**Least Privilege in AWS:** Use IAM to govern access, access can be granted to users, resources, and other AWS services. Determine what type of access a user needs in order to accomplish his work and craft policies to perform only those specific tasks.
