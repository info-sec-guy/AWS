**AWS Shared Responsibility Model:** Amazon Web Services (AWS) is responsible for the cloud (AWS), that includes physical security of data centers, hardware, software, and networking. Customers are responsible for security in the Cloud, protecting customer data, data encryption, Identity and Access Management (IAM), patching operating systems of virtual machines(VMs), and configuring firewalls.

**The 5 Pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework (CROPS):**
1. Cost Optimization
2. Reliability
3. Optimization
4. Performance Efficiency
5. Security

**Least Privilege in AWS:** Use IAM to govern access, access can be granted to users, resources, and other AWS services. Determine what type of access a user needs in order to accomplish his work and craft policies to perform only those specific tasks.

**AWS Compliance Programs:** The [AWS Compliance Program](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/) helps customers to understand the robust controls in place at AWS to maintain security and compliance in the cloud. By tying together governance-focused, audit-friendly service features with applicable compliance or audit standards, AWS Compliance Enablers build on traditional programs, helping customers to establish and operate in an AWS security control environment.
