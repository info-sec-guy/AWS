# AWS Core Services

## Compute Services

**Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** Virtual Server running on AWS, configurable by number of virtual CPUs, GBs of RAM, size/type of storage, and network speed. You only pay for what you use and when you use it, scalable.

**Elastic Beanstalk:** Deploy and scale web applications by uploading code, services deployed using Java, .NET, PHP, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, and Docker. It automatically handles the deployment, from capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk - you pay only for the AWS resources needed to store and run your applications.

**Elastic Load Balancing:** Distributes incoming traffic across multiple replicated servers so one single server is not overloaded, fault-tolerant, scalable, secure, and monitor the health of servers.

**Lambda:** Run code (lambda function) in response to an event, automatically runs uploaded code and scales applications, and pay only for the compute time you consume and each event trigger. 

**Lightsail:** Preconfigured and ready-to-use OS, web applications, and development stacks, scalable with your project's growth, cost-effective monthly fees, one-click-to-launch services. 

**Availability Zones:** Data Centers around the world, independent of each other in network and power, almost 6 dozen AZs around the world. 

**Regions:** Made up of two or more AZs, currently two dozen regions around the world.

**High Availability:** 

- High available resources may have duplicate copies in multiple AZs or even Regions
- Resiliency: Ability to provide uninterrupted performance, even during natural disasters
- Redundancy: Having multiple copies of the data in different data centers
- Architect your AWS Cloud Infrastructure to protect against downtimes cause by natural disasters or power outages


## Storage
**Simple Storage Service (S3):** Object storage service, storing each file as separate entity (object), high availability, security, and performance, scalable, charged only for what you used.

**Elastic Block Store (EBS):**

**Snowball:**

**Storage Gateway:**



## Database
**DynamoDB:**

**Relational Database Service (RDS):**

**Amazon Aurora:**

**Amazon Redshift:**
