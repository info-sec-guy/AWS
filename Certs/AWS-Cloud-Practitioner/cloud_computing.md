# Introduciton to Cloud Computing :cloud::computer:

**What is the Cloud?** The cloud is the internet, it's a global network of connected devices.

**Cloud Computing:** On-demand delivery of compute, database storage, applications, and other IT resources. Features include instant access, access resources where and when you want, more flexible and affordable than legacy IT infrastructure, affordable for organizations and individuals with all budget types.

**Six Advantages of Cloud Computing:** 
* **Trade capital expense for variable expense** - Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.
* **Benefit from massive economies of scale** – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.
* **Stop guessing capacity** – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. 
* **Increase speed and agility** - In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes.
* **Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers** – Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.
* **Go global in minutes** – Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. 

**Cloud Computing Models** 

* **IaaS(host):** Control over the networking, security, servers, closest to having traditional on-premises data center. Examples include AWS, Azure, and GCP. 

* **PaaS(build):** Deploy and manage applications without worry of underlying hardware infrastructure, execute programming languages to host apps, less flexibility 
than IaaS.

* **SaaS(consume):** Finished products, managed by the service provider, easy to use as end user. Least flexibility. Examplees include Outlook anf Gmail.

**Cloud Computing Deployments**
* **Cloud Deployment:** 100% of IT infrastructure on the cloud, all apps migrated to or created in the cloud
* **On-Premise/Private Cloud Deployment:** Use Virtualization to deploy resources in their on-premise data centers, traditional IT infrastructure
* **Hybrid Cloud Deployment:** Data partially on the cloud, and partially in the on-premises data center, can use as backup and disaster recovery solution
